> The Well app is a mental health and mindfulness app built on top of the science of positive psychology. The Well app is more than just another meditation or journaling app; it encourages you to enhance and reflect on your day with structured, guided activities.
> 
> There are 5 daily tasks that the Well app asks you to complete each day: record 3 gratitudes, write a journal entry, perform 3 acts of kindness, exercise for 20 minutes, and meditate for 15 minutes.
