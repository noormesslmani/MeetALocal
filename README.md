Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stacks the app uses:
<br><br>
This project uses the React Native framework. React Native (also known as RN) is a popular JavaScript-based mobile app framework that allows you to build natively-rendered mobile apps for iOS and Android. 
<br><br>
The framework lets you create an application for various platforms by using the same codebase.
<br><br>
The backend is implemented using Laravel which is a free and open-source PHP web framework, intended for the development of web applications following the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
<br><br>
For storing messages, the app uses the Firebase package which is a Google-backed application development software that enables developers to develop iOS, Android and Web apps. Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that enables data to be stored and synced between users in real time.
<br><br>
React-native-maps is used to display user's and locals locations, and autocomplete service is used to fill the names of a place being searched for
